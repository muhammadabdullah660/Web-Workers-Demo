# Web Worker Demo

## Project Description

This React web application demonstrates the use of Web Workers for parallel processing. It generates a large array of random numbers and provides buttons to compare sorting performance with and without Web Workers. An interactive feature applies CSS animations while the Web Worker is processing data, showcasing UI responsiveness.

## Instructions to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-worker-demo.git
   cd web-worker-demo
   ```
````

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

4. **Interact with the Web App:**
   - Click the "Sort Without Web Worker" button to sort the array in the main thread.
   - Click the "Sort With Web Worker" button to sort the array using Web Workers.
   - Explore the "Apply Animation" button to trigger a CSS animation.

## Performance Findings

This project aims to showcase potential performance improvements provided by Web Workers, especially in scenarios involving heavy data processing. Users can compare the processing times of sorting a large array with and without the use of Web Workers.

### Summary:

- **Sorting Without Web Worker:** Traditional sorting in the main thread.
- **Sorting With Web Worker:** Parallelized sorting using Web Workers.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge: Worker Initialization

- **Issue:** Initially faced a `ReferenceError` due to Worker initialization.
- **Solution:** Adjusted the worker initialization code to avoid the error.

### Challenge: Communication Overhead

- **Issue:** Communication overhead between the main thread and Web Worker.
- **Solution:** Optimized data transfer and minimized unnecessary communication.

### Challenge: UI Responsiveness

- **Issue:** Ensuring UI responsiveness during heavy computations.
- **Solution:** Implemented loading indicators and disabled buttons to prevent interference while processing.

### Challenge: Code Organization

- **Issue:** Keeping the code organized and readable.
- **Solution:** Modularized the code, used functions effectively, and followed best practices for maintainability.
